# JIRA Smart Commits

A Node.js git hook script to prefix commits automatically with the JIRA ticket, based on a branch name. 

## Usage

### Installation
1. Install [Husky](https://www.npmjs.com/package/husky) in your project to configure Git hooks easily
    ```
    npm install --save-dev husky
    ``` 
2. Install this package in your project: 
    ```
    npm install --save-dev jira-smart-commit
    ```
3. Configure scripts in `package.json`. The script expects his first argument to be the JIRA tag of the project.
4. Do your git commits like usual. If the branch was prefixed with a JIRA tag, your commit message will get prefixed with
the same tag. E.g. 

```
Branch: TAG-411-husky-git-hooks
Commit message: "Add git hooks to project" â†’ "TAG-411 Add git hooks to project"
```
